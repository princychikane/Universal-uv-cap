["Prototype of a universal UV-C bottle cap for sustainable water purification"]

# Universal UV-C Bottle Cap – Prototype  

## 1. Problem Statement
Industries like Power and Steel require safe drinking water for workers and staff. Traditional water purification methods like RO and chemical treatment are energy-intensive, carbon-heavy, and often not portable.  

There is a need for a compact, energy-efficient, and universal water purification solution.  

## 2. Solution – Universal UV-C Bottle Cap
We propose a solar-chargeable, universal UV-C bottle cap that fits almost any bottle (steel, plastic, glass) and purifies water using UV-C LED technology.  

## 3. How It Works:
- UV-C LED in the cap emits germicidal light inside the bottle.  
- A reflective cone directs the light downward into the water.  
- The light inactivates bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms.  
- A safety sensor ensures the light only works when the cap is tightly closed.  
- Powered by a rechargeable battery or small solar panel, reducing dependency on grid electricity.  

## 4. Key Features:
- **Universal Fit**: Flexible silicone ring seals any bottle tightly.  
- **Portable & Lightweight**: Workers can carry it anywhere.  
- **Energy-Efficient**: UV-C LED consumes minimal power (~100–200 mW).  
- **Safe**: Light only activates when cap is closed; no UV leakage.  
- **Sustainable**: Reduces energy usage compared to RO filters, lowering carbon footprint.  

## 5. Sustainability Impact:
| Parameter          | Traditional RO | UV-C Cap Prototype |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Energy Consumption | High (1–2 kWh/day) | Low (~0.1–0.2 kWh/day) |
| Carbon Footprint   | High           | Minimal            |
| Portability        | Low            | High               |
| Maintenance        | High           | Low                |

## 6. Conclusion:
Adoption of UV-C caps in industrial and household settings can significantly reduce energy consumption and CO₂ emissions, contributing to decarbonization efforts in the power and steel sectors.

## 9. How to Use the Prototype (Future Scope)
1. Attach the UV-C LED cap tightly on a bottle.  
2. Turn on the UV light (auto-sensor safety).  
3. Wait for 3–5 minutes.  
4. Water becomes germ-free and safe to drink.
